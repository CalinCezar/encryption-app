Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or lightly grease it. In a large mixing bowl, cream together the butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until smooth and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla extract. In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until well combined. Be careful not to overmix. Fold in the chocolate chips until evenly distributed throughout the dough. Using a cookie scoop or spoon, drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart. Bake in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown and the centers are set. Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Enjoy your delicious homemade chocolate chip cookies with a glass of milk or your favorite hot beverage!\r\n";
